# Cellestra Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how Cellestra handles data when you use its services on Discord.

1. Information We Collect

Cellestra only collects **minimal, non-personal information** necessary for bot functionality:

* **Server IDs** – to manage settings (e.g., prefix, default volume)
* **Command usage data** – used anonymously for debugging and performance monitoring

We **do not collect**:

* Personal information (e.g., name, email, location)
* Discord bios, preferences, or private messages
* IP addresses or any tracking data

2. How We Use This Information

Collected data is used **only for functional and operational purposes**, such as:

* Providing and improving bot features
* Detecting abuse or misuse of commands
* Ensuring stable bot performance

3. Data Retention

We retain minimal data **only as long as necessary** for the Bot’s functionality. If the Bot is removed from a server, associated settings and stored data may be deleted automatically or upon request.

4. Your Rights

As a server admin or user:

* You may request deletion of server-related settings
* You may remove the Bot at any time to stop data handling
* You may contact us for any concerns via our support server

5. Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the integrity of the Bot and its data. However, as with any online service, no system is completely secure.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be announced in our [support server](https://discord.gg/AZ48HU62vD). Continued use of the Bot implies acceptance of the updated policy.
